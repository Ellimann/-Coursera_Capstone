📘 Machine Learning Practice Exercise 1 — Python Implementation
Welcome to my Machine Learning Practice Exercise 1 repository. This project is part of my hands-on learning journey in Applied Machine Learning, where I explore essential ML concepts using Python, covering data preprocessing, exploratory data analysis (EDA), and regression modeling.

🔍 Project Overview
This notebook is designed as a foundational exercise in applying Machine Learning workflows using Python. The dataset used focuses on car attributes and their relationship with Miles per Gallon (mpg), helping to build intuition for regression analysis, feature engineering, and evaluation metrics.

Key Tasks Covered:
📂 Loading and inspecting the dataset using pandas

📈 Visualizing data trends with matplotlib and seaborn

🧹 Cleaning and preprocessing: handling null values, renaming columns

📊 Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA): histograms, pairplots, heatmaps

🧮 Feature selection using correlation matrix and data types

🤖 Building a Linear Regression model using scikit-learn

🧪 Model evaluation: R² score, residual analysis, and predictions

🧰 Technologies Used
Python 3.11+

Jupyter Notebook

pandas

numpy

matplotlib

seaborn

scikit-learn
